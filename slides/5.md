# Behind the Scenes

- Hooks operate as a queue
- Take an `initialState`
- React will give the appropriate state based on the calling order
- When a component is updated, a function is called to take the new value, then another is called to store the latest value as the `memoizedState`

```javascript
{
  memoizedState: "foo",
  next: {
    memoizedState: "bar",
    next: {
      memoizedState: "baz",
      next: null
    }
  }
}
```

>Memoization - In computing, memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. 

There is a cost associated with memoization - trading __speed__ for __space__ in memory
