# Behind the Scenes

- Hooks are a queue
- Dispatcher object
- React communicates with renderer (ReactDOM)

```javascript
  function useFoo(...args) {
    const dispatcher = resolveDispatcher()
    return dispatcher.useFoo(...args)
  }
};
```

- Take an `initialState`
- React will give the appropriate state based on the calling order

```javascript
{
  memoizedState: "foo",
  next: {
    memoizedState: "bar",
    next: {
      memoizedState: "baz",
      next: null
    }
  }
}
```

>Memoization - In computing, memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. 

__SPEED__ vs __SPACE__
